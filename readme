/*
*	Description:
*	In embedded programming a helloworld program is usually
*	making an LED blink. This is exactly what this program does.
*	The arduino is not programmed with the arduino IDE, instead
*	we are "talking" directly to the Atmel Mega328p in the C 
*	programming language.

1) Hook up a resistor and a LED to Pin 8 of the Arduino board
2) take a look at the code, then at the makefile if you want
3) to build object files, as well as an executable use command make
4) to build an hex file that you can upload to the arduino use make hex
5) to check if arduino is reachable with avrdude use make read
6) to flash the chip on the arduino with the code use make write
   --> now the LED should blink

	In short:
		1) make
		2) make hex
		3) make read
		4) make write

Use "make clean" if you want to start over building the source files

Why program the arduino in pure C? 

	I think it's more fun
	I think you can learn more
	Don't recommend this for people that just started out with
	programming the arduino or electronics though...
